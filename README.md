# Spam-Email-Classifier
# Build a spam email classifier using Python and pandas. Preprocess the dataset (`emails.csv`) to tokenize and clean text data. Train a classifier like Naive Bayes or SVM, evaluate its performance with metrics like accuracy, and optimize using techniques such as hyperparameter tuning for effective spam detection.
